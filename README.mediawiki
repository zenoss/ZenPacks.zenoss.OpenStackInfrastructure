This ZenPack allows for monitoring of OpenStack. This means that you can monitor the flavors, images and servers from a user or consumer perspective. OpenStack API versions 1.0 and 1.1 are supported. Please watch the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-43gnQLbX9g Monitoring OpenStack] video for a quick introduction that covers most of the details below.

{{note}} The video is of an early version of the ZenPack that doesn't have as many options when adding an OpenStack endpoint. See the usage notes below for help with the new fields available on the ''Add OpenStack'' dialog.

<blockquote>
OpenStack is a global collaboration of developers and cloud computing technologists producing the ubiquitous open source cloud computing platform for public and private clouds. The project aims to deliver solutions for all types of clouds by being simple to implement, massively scalable, and feature rich. The technology consists of a series of interrelated projects delivering various components for a cloud infrastructure solution.
</blockquote>

== Usage ==
Once the OpenStack ZenPack is installed you can begin monitoring by going to the infrastructure screen and clicking the normal button for adding devices. You'll find a new option labeled, "Add OpenStack."

Choose that option and you'll be presented with a dialog asking for the following inputs.

# Username - Same username used to login to OpenStack web interface
# API Key - Can be found by going to "Your Account/API Access"
# Project ID - This can be left blank if you don't know what it is
# Auth URL - For Rackspace this would be https://auth.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0
# Region Name - This can be left blank if you don't know what it is

Once you click Add, Zenoss will contact the OpenStack API and discover servers, images and flavors. Once it is complete you'll find a new device in the OpenStack device class with the same name as the hostname or IP you entered into the dialog. Click into this new device to see everything that was discovered.

The following types of elements are discovered.
* Servers
* Images
* Flavors

The following metrics are collected.
* Total Servers and Servers by State
** States: Active, Build, Rebuild, Suspended, Queue Resize, Prep Resize, Resize, Verify Resize, Password, Rescue, Reboot, Hard Reboot, Delete IP, Unknown, Other
* Total Images and Images by State
** States: Active, Saving, Preparing, Queued, Failed, Unknown, Other
* Total Flavors

Status monitoring is performed on servers and images with the following mapping of state to Zenoss event severity.

;Servers State to Severity Mapping
: Reboot, Hard Reboot, Build, Rebuild, Rescue, Unknown == Critical
: Resize == Error
: Prep Resize, Delete IP == Warning
: Suspended, Queue Resize, Verify Resize, Password == Info
: Active == Clear

;Images State to Severity Mapping
: Failed, Unknown == Critical
: Queued, Saving, Preparing == Info
: Active == Clear

If you are also using Zenoss to monitor the guest operating system running within the server Zenoss will present the graphs for that operating system when the graphs option is chosen for the OpenStack server.
