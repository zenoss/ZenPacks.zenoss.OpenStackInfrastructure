basereportable - upgraded versions of the ZenETL basereportables which
provide a more appropriate default behavior for zenpacks.

These adapters automatically export all properties and relationships of any
model object they are applied to in a consistent manner.

Enabling basic analytics model export support for a ZenPack can be done entirely
through ZCML as follows:

Add the following to configure.zcml:

    <!-- Analytics -->
    <include file="reportable.zcml"
             xmlns:zcml="http://namespaces.zope.org/zcml"
             zcml:condition="installed ZenPacks.zenoss.ZenETL" />


The contents of reportable.zcml will depend on the structure of your ZenPack.

The goal is to bind the BaseReportable and BaseReportableFactory adapters to
every model class in your ZenPack, most particularly to those that inherit from
Device or DeviceComponent.

If you are using zenpacklib, all devices and devicecomponents inherit from
a common base class, so you can simply use the following:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <configure xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope"
               xmlns:browser="http://namespaces.zope.org/browser"
               >

      <!-- Define the reportable schema -->

      <adapter factory=".basereportable.BaseReportable"
               for=".zenpacklib.Device"
               provides="Products.Zuul.interfaces.IReportable"
               />

      <adapter factory=".basereportable.BaseReportableFactory"
               for=".zenpacklib.Device"
               provides="Products.Zuul.interfaces.IReportableFactory"
               />

      <adapter factory=".basereportable.BaseReportable"
               for=".zenpacklib.Component"
               provides="Products.Zuul.interfaces.IReportable"
               />

      <adapter factory=".basereportable.BaseReportableFactory"
               for=".zenpacklib.Component"
               provides="Products.Zuul.interfaces.IReportableFactory"
               />

    </configure>

All of the device/devicecomponent schema classes will inherit these adapters
automatically.

If you are not using zenpacklib, but you do have a similar base class that most
components inherit from, you may bind to that class instead.  If your ZenPack's
devicecomponents do not share a common base class within your zenpack, then
you will need to bind each one individually.  For example, in StorageBase,
we would have:

      <adapter factory=".basereportable.BaseReportable"
               for=".HardDisk.HardDisk"
               provides="Products.Zuul.interfaces.IReportable"
               />

      <adapter factory=".basereportable.BaseReportableFactory"
               for=".HardDisk.HardDisk"
               provides="Products.Zuul.interfaces.IReportableFactory"
               />

      <adapter factory=".basereportable.BaseReportable"
               for=".LUN.LUN"
               provides="Products.Zuul.interfaces.IReportable"
               />

      <adapter factory=".basereportable.BaseReportableFactory"
               for=".LUN.LUN"
               provides="Products.Zuul.interfaces.IReportableFactory"
               />

   (etc, for every class)


Generally, creating this ZCML file is all you will need to do in order to get
a reasonable implementation of Reportable adapters for your ZenPack.

To test the result, you may invoke this script directly:

    python basereportable.py <device name>

It will output all of the data that will be sent to analytics.  (Note that you
must install the ZenETL zenpack in order to even run this test!)

If this data looks reasonable, you're done.   If you find that some of the
reportables need tweaking, you may subclass the BaseReportable class provided
in this file and extend the reportProperties method.   If you are unhappy with
the naming of the entities or columns, you may modify the naming in 
entity_class_for_class, as follows:


    import basereportable
    from ZenPacks.zenoss.OpenStackInfrastructure.SoftwareComponent import SoftwareComponent


    class BaseReportable(basereportable.BaseReportable):

        @classmethod
        def entity_class_for_class(cls, object_class):
            entity_class = super(BaseReportable, cls).entity_class_for_class(object_class)
            return entity_class.replace("open_stack", "openstack")


Another customization you may wish to do is to output some of your components
in multiple analytics tables.  This is particularly important if you have
subclassed a component class that is provided outside of your ZenPack.

For example, if you subclass IpInterface and create MyIpInterface, by default,
your data will only go into the dim_my_ip_interface table, not into
dim_ip_interface.  This could cause your interfaces to not show up in analytics
reports that are meant to show "all" interfaces, for instance.

To correct this, subclass BaseReportable, and provide an export_as_bases
similar to that shown below.  The idea is to, based on context, return a list
of parent classes to "also" export as.   This may be a class within
your zenpack, or outside of it.

    @property
    def export_as_bases(self):
        bases = super(BaseReportable, self).export_as_bases

        # Anything that is a IPInterface subclass, also export
        # as a IPInterface.
        if isinstance(self.context, IPInterface):
            bases.append(IPInterface)

        # Anything that is a softwarecomponent subclass, also export
        # as a softwarecomponent.
        if isinstance(self.context, SoftwareComponent):
            bases.append(SoftwareComponent)

        return bases

Generally this is the extent of customization you are likely to require for
most ZenPacks.   However, these classes can be subclassed to add almost any
functionality, if you really need to.  It is our hope, however, to get to
the point where the default adapters will just "do the right thing" without
any need to subclass.
