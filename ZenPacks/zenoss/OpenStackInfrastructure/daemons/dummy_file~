The 'daemons' directory is required because the service definition determines the 
path to the healthcheck script relative to this directory.  (%(daemondir) is the
only reference to the zenpack path that is available in service definitions).
 
This file must exist to allow git to store what would be an empty directory.
The file must end with the ~ character so that the ZenPackLoader 
for the daemons directory will ignore it.
