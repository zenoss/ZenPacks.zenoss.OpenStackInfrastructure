    Provide a black box which you can insert object maps into, and then
    drain object maps out of.  The maps will be held for a period of time
    before they are released, and incremental changes aggregated into a smaller
    set of effective changes, when possible, according to the following rules:

    * If a component is created by a map (_add=True), hold all updates
      to this component for a period of time (shortlived_seconds).  If a
      map comes in during that time to delete that same component, discard
      all maps for it and don't waste zenhub's time.

    * If a component is deleted (_remove=True), discard any other pending
      object maps for this component, and release the remove datamap immediately.
      In addition, store the component ID in a blacklist for
      (delete_blacklist_seconds) seconds.

    * If any objmap comes in for a blacklisted component, drop it.

    * For all other updates, build an aggregate datamap, overlaying each
      new datamap's changes onto it, until its age reaches
      update_consolidate_seconds, then release it for consumption.
