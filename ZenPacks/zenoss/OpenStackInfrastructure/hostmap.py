class HostMap(object):
    """
    The concept of the HostMap is to accept all of the "host references"
    (names by which hosts are referred to during modeling of an openstack
    environment) and to produce a canonical host ID (ID of a host component
    in ZODB) and host name (label to apply to this component) for each.

    This is done by creating a HostMap object, adding all of the hostrefs (host
    references, which may be hostnames, host IPs, or hostnames with prefixes
    or suffixes.. whatever that OpenStack APIs return), and telling the
    HostMap to "do its thing", and then retrieving the generated host IDs.

    The process can be guided in two ways:
        - by extending the "perform_mapping" function, to make it aware
          of new and interesting ways to determine an ID for a host reference
        - by calling "assert_same_host", which tells the mapper that two
          host references refer to the same host.  For instance, a host
          and its IP, or a host's short name and its FQDN.   These assertions
          are interpreted as authoritative, and unless contradictory, will
          be considered law.

    For a given reference, the same ID should always be returned, unless new
    information (such as an assert_same_host directive) makes that impossible.
    This persistence is achieved by storing the results of freeze_mappings
    in the database, and passing that into thaw_mappings during the next
    modeling cycle.
