Ceilometer Event Definitions for Zenoss
---------------------------------------

Zenoss maintains its model using zenmodeler to do a complete poll of the 
target openstack environment (every 12 hours by default).

Because openstack is fairly dynamic, with new instances being created, destroyed,
and their states changed, the zenpack also uses events generated by OpenStack's
ceilometer to update its model in between polling cycles.  This allows
the zenoss model to be kept current in near real-time.

Each ceilometer event contains a number of properties about the object 
the event is describing.  The set of properties included in an event
are referred to as the event's traits.

For example, an event about an instance being created might include its 
name, the host it is being created upon, how much memory is allocated to it,
etc.  These traits are used to set the corresponding properties in the zenoss
model.

The set of traits included in each property are defined in openstack's
/etc/ceilometer/event_definitions.yaml file.

It is recommended to add the contents of the file 'zenoss_additions.yaml' to
the end of your event_definitions.yaml if possible, as this will ensure that
all events include the traits that zenoss needs.
  
While the default file included in openstack is sufficient for basic model updates, it lacks some event traits that the zenpack would normally be 
able to take advantage of.  If the event_defintions.yaml file is left in its
default state, you can expect the following issues:

* All Supported Openstack Versions

The events related to networking objects are very minimal by default.
These properties and relationships can not be updated from them, and will
be left blank until the next modeling cycle:

FloatingIp:
  Properties: Attached IP, Floating IP, Status
  Relationships: Network, Port and Router
Network:
  Properties: Name, Admin State, Type, Net External, Status
  Relationships: Floating IP, Port, Router  
Port:
  Properties: Name, Admin State, Type, MAC, Status, Fixed IPs
  Relationships: Floating IP, Instance, Network
Router:
  Properties: Name, Admin State, Routes, Status
  Relationships: Floating IP, Network, Subnet
Subnet:
  Properties: Name, CIDR, Gateway, DNS Nameservers
  Relationships: Router, Network

For objects where the name attribute is not available, the name will be set to the object's ID until the next modeling cycle.


* OpenStack Queens (Red Hat OSP 13)

Newly created or attached volumes will not be linked to the appropriate
instances in Zenoss until the next modeling cycle.

The 'size' property of snapshots will not update until the next modeling cycle.


* OpenStack Pike (Red Hat OSP 12)

In events and the model, the instances will not have their proper names.
The ID of the instance will be shown instead, until the next
modeling cycle, which will populate the names.

Newly created or attached volumes will not be linked to the appropriate
instances in Zenoss until the next modeling cycle.

The 'size' property of snapshots will not update until the next modeling
