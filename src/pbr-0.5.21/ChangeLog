    Replace setuptools_git with a smarter approach
    
    Implement a local egg_info command that only re-generates the
    SOURCES.txt file when we need to. That is:
    
     - If there is no SOURCES.txt, make one
     - If we have run the sdist command, make one
    
    Otherwise, leave well enough alone.
    
    Also, skip doing any git processing if SKIP_GIT_SDIST is specified.
    
    This should mean that consumers of our tarballs should not get screwed
    by the need to inject git processing into the sdist.

    Clean up some style warnings

    checker for bash. tools/integration.sh was mostly clean, but it
    suggested that `` should be replaced with $(). Sure, why not.

    Consume the OpenStack mirror by default
    
    PyPI upstream obviously breaks all the time. Like, literally, I've spent
    my whole life dealing with it this past week. In this test, we were
    avoiding the OpenStack mirror so that we could be sure to be testing
    that we could build the mirror when new requirements are added. However,
    the only time that's a concern is on a requirements repo change.
    
    Add an option --no-mirror that will trigger the "don't use OpenStack's
    mirrors as an upstream" behavior, and we'll add that option to the
    invocation on requirements changes.

    Swap the order of configparser imports
    
    The configparser backport package has un-understood issues parsing
    our files. But the intent of the code is to use whichever is the
    package for the version of python in use. So, instead of trying to
    install the python3 version first, which can also result in loading
    the backport package, first try the python2 package, so that if
    configparser itself is loaded, it will be because we're running python3.

    Stop trying to install old pip and setuptools
    
    Now that pip 1.4 is out, setuptools<0.7 is invalid because 1.4 will not
    install 'pre-release' software without being explicitly asked, and all
    of the pre 0.7 setuptools releases have a letter in them. Just stop
    trying to do it, because we actually don't use it anyway.
    
    Additionally, we were trying to intsall pip 1.3 for a test but were not
    installing that into the local mirror. Match them so that they're equal
    and can install.

    Revert include_package_data change
    
    Setting the value directly in kwargs is not doing what we want it to do.
    This is largely because of how the hook system works. When the hooks
    process backwards_compat, they do a config.get('backwards_compat',
    dict()), which is then written back to the config dict - which means
    that blank override values are being fed in.
    
    Later we can go through and just re-engineer how that works. For now,
    unbreak nova.

    If you're running pbr codepaths, you want the hook. There is no need
    to say "pbr=True" in setup.py and then to list the hook in setup.cfg
    now that d2to1 is in the tree.

    Explicitly install install_requires.
    
    PBR uses distutils.install instead of setuptools.install to provide
    non-egg based installs. This is effectively the same behavior as the
    --single-version-externally-managed flag to setuptools, which is what
    distro packagers use inside of debs and rpms. We do this so that we
    can do things like install manpages and config files.
    
    Unfortunately, this has the unintended consequence of completely
    skipping dependency processing.
    
    Add the logic from distribute into our install class to ensure that
    the contents of install_requires are installed appropriately.
    
    In the future, we'll want to replace this method with one that uses
    pip instead of easy_install. Since we're doing the work now in our
    code, we might as well do it well.

commit 2dc50ea1e467fa5a301fc6b6812b798599f0ac04
Author: Mark McLoughlin <markmc@redhat.com>
Date:   Wed May 29 21:45:16 2013 +0100

    Handle versioned egg fragments in dependency URLs
    
    If you include a dependency URL in your requirements file that has an
    egg fragment e.g.
    
      http://tarballs.openstack.org/oslo.config/oslo.config-1.2.0a2.tar.gz#egg=oslo.config
    
    we include the full URL in dependency_links (as you'd expect), but also
    include the egg fragment in our requires.
    
    With oslo.config, we're seeing a situation where 1.1.1 is installed and,
    while pip knows that 1.2.0a2 is available (via dependency_links),
    because our requires only say 'oslo.config' and we haven't passed
    --upgrade, then pip sees the requirement as satisfied and doesn't
    install 1.2.0a2.
    
    What we really want to express is "we require at least 1.2.0a2 and
    here's where you can find it" so, for example, we'll be happy if a newer
    version is installed or available from pypi but, if not, then we'll
    install from the supplied URL.
    
    Now, egg fragments can be versioned e.g.
    
      http://tarballs.openstack.org/oslo.config/oslo.config-1.2.0a2.tar.gz#egg=oslo.config-1.2.0a2
    
    but we need to transform the fragment so our requires becomes:
    
      oslo.config>=1.2.0a2
    
    We should be fine for a backwards compatibility perspective, because
    an egg fragment which included a hyphen just wouldn't have worked.

    openstack.common.setup: fails to get version from git
    
    quantum run_tests.py fails because
    openstack.common.setup._get_version_from_git fails.  It is because
    quantum unit tests run under quantum/tests/unit instead of git root dir.
    So the function should check parent dirs for .git.

    Use oslo-config-2013.1b3
    
    The cfg API is now available via the oslo-config library, so switch to
    it and remove the copied-and-pasted version.
    
    Add the 2013.1b3 tarball to tools/pip-requires - this will be changed
    to 'oslo-config>=2013.1' when oslo-config is published to pypi. This
    will happen in time for grizzly final.
    
    Remove the 'deps = pep8==1.3.3' and 'deps = pyflakes' from tox.ini as
    it means all the other deps get installed with easy_install which can't
    install oslo-config from the URL.

    Change the check for the existence of .git directory.
    
    In common setup the check for the .git directory is too
    restrictive. Instead of checking that it is a directory just
    check to see if it exists. That way if the project is part
    of a submodule it will continue to work correctly.

    Remove openstack.common.db.common
    
    Since this only contains exceptions that are either used in session.py
    or utils.py (not both), it seems sensible to move them into the modules
    where they are used.
    
    Also, remove the use of the Invalid base exception class since we don't
    seem to be making use of the base class anywhere by catching it rather
    than the more specialized exceptions.

    setup: count revs for revno if there are no tags
    
    We currently use 'git describe --always' to figure out the number of
    commits there have been leading up to the HEAD commit.
    
    However, if there are no tags in the repo, git-describe just returns
    the sha hash of HEAD and we fail.
    
    In that case, use 'git rev-list HEAD | wc -l' so we can be  #winning.

commit 642a479597be03e3c2dd40e13ca3e47e2ec38682
Author: Mark McLoughlin <markmc@redhat.com>
Date:   Mon Jan 21 14:13:59 2013 +0000

    Move logging config options into the log module
    
    We learned a lesson in Nova - it's best to declare and use config
    options within a single module if possible. Globally declared and
    use config options grow like weeds and it becomes harder to find out
    if, where and how individual options are used.
    
    Strangely, in cfg itself, we randomly declare a bunch of logging options
    which are only used within the openstack.common.log module - let's move
    the options there and remove the CommonConfigOpts class before they
    become part of the API we commit to when oslo-config is released.
    
    A minor detail in the patch - the logfile and logdir options are already
    deprecated in favour of log_file and log_dir, but we never got around to
    removing all other traces of the deprecated options.

    Use revno and git sha for pre-release versioning.
    
    In discussions with ttx and zul, it became clear that the git describe info
    for our intra-release case wasn't providing any value and was providing
    confusion. Additionally, plain git sha's are not providing enough info.
    
    So, the scheme settled on that breaks the least amount of things and yet
    still reduces complexity is:
    
    if pre-version: # server projects
      try:
        use current tag
      except:
        use pre-version+revcount+gitsha
    else:
      use git describe | s/-/./
    
    Additionally, we'll use a as a prefix for the revcount, b as the prefix for
    the milestone portion of a milestone tag, and rc as the prefix for rc's, so
    that for our releases, python version sorting works as expected.

    Rolling back to previous version of resolve_name; it's possible this can fail in the presence of a broken namespace package, but I want to make sure that's the case before trying to fix it.

    Stop using no longer valid -E option for pip
    
    Fixes bug 1100403
    
    Version 1.1 of pip dropped the -E option. It's not necessary anyway since
    running pip in a correctly setup virtualenv will automatically do the right
    thing.

    Make tox run doctests
    
    Use 'nosetests --with-doctests' to run any doctests found. We currently
    only use doctests in a handful of places, but we may as well run them
    to ensure they work.
    
    Make the cfg doctests avoid using the global CONF since we would need
    to reset its state between each doctest.
    
    Fix the cliutils doctests to actually pass.
    
    Use 'nosetests --exclude-dir=tests/testmods' to avoid loading the
    modules from this dir while discovering doctests. The cfg unit tests
    rely on these modules not having been previously loaded.

    Simplify version processing.
    
    In response to the cessation of per-commit tarballs produced by the CI
    systems, simplify the version processing code. We did many many many
    complicated things to support producing release artifacts that were not
    actually supported release artifacts. After a bunch of issues emerged, it was
    determined that the best way forward was to stop producing quasi-not-really
    non-release tarballs. If people want to consume versions of openstack that
    are not released versions, the git repos are always available.
    
    Additionally, this patch removes versioninfo and just uses PKG-INFO and
    pkg_resources to handle version processing.

    Revert "Support lookup of value using "group.key""
    
    This reverts commit 525ac47.
    
    There are already two ways to reference an option in a group:
    
      CONF.group.key
      CONF[group].key
    
    Adding a third variant doesn't seem ideal. Also, for the specific case
    of LazyPluggable in Nova, we can easily just pass an optional config
    group name to the constructor.

    Support lookup of value using "group.key"
    
    Let us check if the opt_name has a '.', if it does then split it
    into a group/key and try lookup using that combination. Since
    LazyPluggable uses "CONF[self.__pivot]" if we just add this
    capability to cfg, we get "LazyPluggable doesn't support
    option groups" for free.

    Add deprecated --logfile common opt.
    
    This adds a deprecated common options for --logfile which
    is an alias for --log_file. This resolves some backwards compatability
    issues with the most recent oslo common code where --logfile
    was no longer a valid opt.

    Fix set_default() with boolean CLI options
    
    Porting to argparse broke set_default() with boolean CLI options. The
    new test case shows this borkage.
    
    The issue is that, by default, argparse differs subtly from optparse in
    its handling of defaults for boolean options. Compare:
    
      >>> p = optparse.OptionParser()
      >>> p.add_option('--foo', action='store_true')
      >>> p.add_option('--bar', action='store_true', default=False)
      >>> p.parse_args([])
      (<Values at 0x7f28aba066c8: {'foo': None, 'bar': False}>, [])
    
    to:
    
      >>> p = argparse.ArgumentParser()
      >>> p.add_argument('--foo', action='store_true')
      >>> p.add_argument('--bar', action='store_true', default=False)
      >>> p.add_argument('--blaa', action='store_true', default=None)
      >>> p.parse_args([])
      Namespace(bar=False, blaa=None, foo=False)
    
    i.e. unless you specify a default for a boolean option, optparse
    defaults to None whereas argparse defaults to False. To get the
    same optparse behaviour with argparse, you need default=None.

    Improve cfg's argparse sub-parsers support
    
    In order for sub-parsers to be useful, you need some way of knowing
    which sub-parser was chosen during argument parsing. It's pretty obvious
    from the current sub-parsers test case that we don't have a convenient
    interface for this.
    
    One way of doing it is to use the 'dest' argument when adding
    sub-parsers:
    
      >>> subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='cmd')
      >>> subparsers.add_parser('a')
      >>> subparsers.add_parser('b')
      >>> parser.parse_args(['a'])
      Namespace(cmd='a')
    
    The most sensible way to map this into cfg concepts is to register
    sub-parsers as an Opt. This way, we can make name and argument values
    of the sub-parser as an attribute on the ConfigOpts object:
    
      >>> def add_parsers(subparsers):
      ...     a = subparsers.add_parser('a')
      ...     a.add_argument('id')
      ...     b = subparsers.add_parser('b')
      ...
      >>> CONF.register_cli_opt(SubCommandOpt('cmd', handler=add_parsers))
      True
      >>> CONF(['a', '10'])
      >>> CONF.cmd.name, CONF.cmd.id
      ('a', '10')
    
    The handler method is a bit awkward, but each time cfg is to parse
    command line args it takes all the registered opts and creates a new
    argparse parser. So we need to be able to re-add the sub-parsers each
    time.

    Make project pyflakes clean.
    
    Added both a tox test-env for pyflakes and fixed the current pyflakes errors.
    This did actually fix a couple of bugs.
    
    The CI team has started using pyflakes on its projects and also has started
    using oslo for things, so ignoring pyflakes warnings on the oslo code was
    starting to get old. However, additionally, pyflakes is pretty solid, so we
    should maybe consider gating on it across the board. (% locals() is the
    biggest thing that we do that it doesn't like)

    Add support for positional arguments
    
    argparse makes it awkward to implement the current cfg API where we
    simply return the leftover arguments to the caller.
    
    Very few cfg users actually rely on this functionality and for those
    cases it probably makes more sense for them to explicitly register
    positional arguments or sub-parsers.
    
    Add support for positional arguments via a 'required' Opt attribute:
    
      opt = StrOpt('foo', positional=True)
      conf.register_cli_opt(opt)
      conf(['bar'])
      conf.foo == 'bar'

    Completely remove cfg's disable_interspersed_args()
    
    The use case for disable_interspersed_args() is that nova-manage
    needs to be able to parse sub-commands. We now have a
    add_cli_subparsers() method which better supports this use case.

    argparse support for cfg
    
    * openstack/common/cfg.py
      Optparse is fading out since python 2.7, this
      patch will help openstack/common work on more
      advanded version of python(argparse).
      Now, disable_interspersed_args() has no effect.
      Added new method add_cli_subparsers, return
      argparse  subparser, for  usages  such  as
      subcommand.
    
    * tests/unit/test_cfg.py
      SubcommandTestCase added.
      Disabled test_disable_interspersed_args test entry
      for happiness of tox, temporarily.
      Modified test_help for port of argparse.
    
    * tools/pip-requires
      include argparse module for python 2.6

    Remove the config module.  All core openstack projects are using the cfg
    module instead so no further development will be done on this module.
    
    Also remove the extensions module.  This code was imported but there has
    been no attempt to get any projects to use it.

    Fix a couple of file handle leaks, using with statements.
    
    In practice unclosed file handle leaks are not a huge deal in CPython code,
    because reference counting means they get closed automatically in a timely
    manner.  But they're bad style, and they can become a real problem if the
    code is run with a version of Python that doesn't use reference counting.

    Added a method for parsing host:port pairs.
    
    The method works correctly with ipv6.
    An alternative way would be to use urlparse, but urlparse
    only works correctly starting with Python 2.7, so to be
    compatible, we have to reimplement this part.
    
    The method will be used for parsing Glance API server
    addresses, RabbitMQ addresses and perhaps other things.

    cfg: clean up None value handling
    
    Remove the need for an internal NoneValue class by making the existence
    of the 'default' or 'override' keys signify whether a default or
    override is set.

    Allow set_default and set_override to use None
    
    The current implementation interprets set_default('foo', None) and
    set_override('foo', None) as 'clear the existing default or override',
    which makes it impossible to override a value with None.
    
    This patch adds support for overriding with a None value by adding
    a special internal class. set_override('foo', None) will now override
    the existing value with None. This is a slight change to the existing
    behavior, so this patch adds two calls for the old functionality of
    clearing defaults and overrides. Example syntax for the new calls
    are shown below:
    
    conf.clear_default('foo')
    conf.clear_override('foo')
    
    The patch also updates the tests to reflect the change in functionality
    and adds new tests to verify the new functionality.

    Add import_opt() method to ConfigOpts
    
    Related to blueprint cfg-global-object
    
    When using the global config object pattern, you often have modules
    which define options that are referenced in other options.
    
    So, for example if module A defined option 'foo' and module be needed
    to reference that option, you might do:
    
      import A
      print CONF.foo
    
    However, this makes it entirely unclear to the casual reader why
    module A was imported.
    
    Nova has a flags.DECLARE() function that helps with this problem
    by allowing you to do:
    
      flags.DECLARE('foo', 'A')
    
    The function simply imports module A and checks that the 'foo'
    option is now defined in the global config object.
    
    This is fine, but it is also implicit that this function applies
    to the global config object. Instead, let's do the following:
    
      CONF.import_opt('foo', 'A')

    Add support for tag based versioning.
    
    Versions driven by git.
    If the current revision is tagged, then that's the version cut.
    If not, for post-versioning, the current version is the tag plus an count of the
    revs since the tag.
    For pre-versioning, it's the logic that's in create-tarball.sh.
    Additionally, a versioninfo file is added to the tree so that pkg-resources
    can find out what the version is.

    Add autodoc generation to the build_sphinx command
    
    The logic is pulled from the nova code, but has been abstracted
    from being nova specific. It allows us to duplicate less info,
    because we know a lot of the meta information in setup.py anyway.
    
    Once this is in, we'll get autodoc module information everywhere
    pretty much for free, and we can delete the doc/ext dir and the
    doc/*sh from nova. (thanks to bcwaldon for pushing things to be
    better)

    cfg: move constructor args to __call__() args
    
    In order to effectively use a global ConfigOpts object, you
    need to be able to initialize the global object with none of
    the information we currently require at construction.
    
    By moving those constructor args to the __call__() method,
    we enable the global object usage model but also make the API
    generally more flexible. For example, you can now reset the
    object and re-use it for parsing a different set of config
    files with the same options.
    
    There are a couple of other minor behavior changes as a
    result:
    
      - print_usage() and print_help() no longer works before
        the object has been called to parse options
    
      - registration of duplicate short options are no longer
        detected until the options are parsed
    
      - the --config-file and --config-dir options aren't
        registered until just before parsing the options since
        the default set of config files can be specified at
        that time
    
      - find_file() can't be used until after the options have
        been parsed, again because of the late registration
        of --config-file and --config-dir
    
    Finally, an unregister_opt() method is added to support
    the re-registeration of the --config-file and --config-dir
    options.

    cfg: make reset() clear defaults and overrides
    
    Fixes bug #998396
    
    Both Nova and Keystone need to clear the overrides on their config
    object between test runs. It's reasonable to expect the reset()
    method would do this, so let's make it so.
    
    Also add a clear() method with the old behaviour.

    Most services have the need to locate files like api-paste.ini or

    This new method attempts to find these files by looking alongside
    the config files already parsed by ConfigOpts and, failing that,
    falls back to a standard set of directories.

    Support for directory source of config files
    
    Implements bp cfg-config-dir
    
    Allow multiple config files to be pulled in from a config directory,
    as opposed to individual config files being explicitly enumerated.
    
    This logic is enabled using the --config-dir=/path/to/config CLI option,
    causing config to be retrived from all matching /path/to/config/*.conf
    files.
    
    Sections may be re-opened across config files, and all config items
    must reside in an explicitly specified section (i.e. it does not default
    to [DEFAULT]). This behavior is unchanged.

    Some refactoring of the cfg cache
    
    A fairly misc bunch of changes:
    
     - init cache before registering config-file and just let
       register_cli_opt() clear the empty cache
    
     - use @__clear_cache on set_default() and set_override() since
       these are just used by the unit tests and doing so allows us
       to kill _remove_from_cache()
    
     - use @__clear_cache on reset() too
    
     - remove recursion from _get() and the substitute param

    Change behavior in utils.import_object().
    
    Fix bug 972859.
    
    Prior to this patch, utils.import_object(foo) and
    utils.import_class(foo) would return the same thing if foo was the path
    to a class.  This patch changes utils.import_object() to return an
    instance of the class, instead, also allowing you to pass in arguments
    to the constructor.
    
    This patch also removes the odd behavior of import_object() to be able
    to also import a module.  Instead, a new function import_module() has
    been added.
    
    Finally, the three import helpers have been moved to a new module,
    importutils.

    This function provides a constant-time string comparison.  Its primary
    use case is for authentication to avoid timing vulnerabilities.  Similar
    functions currently exist in keystone, nova, and swift.  The three
    diverged in slight ways immediately after going in.  This version comes
    from keystone, which I consider the "best" version to promote to
    openstack-common.

    Add the Mapping interface to cfg.ConfigOpts
    
    Implements blueprint cfg-mapping interface
    
    With cfg, option values are accessed via attributes on ConfigOpts
    objects e.g.
    
      conf = ConfigOpts()
      conf.register_opt(StrOpt('foo'))
      conf()
      print conf.foo
    
    One use case that isn't easily supported with option values represented
    this way is iterating over all the registered options. Standard
    interfaces for listing attributes on an object aren't suitable because
    they will list more than just the options.
    
    For this use case alone, it's worth having ConfigOpts implement the
    mapping interface. That way we can do e.g.
    
      for opt, value in conf.items():
          print "Option %s = %s" % (opt, value)
    
    It's interesting to compare argparse's approach to this problem - option
    values are attributes on a Namespace object which has no attributes or
    methods to pollute the namespace of option names. This is a nice
    approach, but would mean that we would be passing around both a
    ConfigOpts object and a Namespace object. That's a bit too much overhead,
    and the mapping interface provides a usable workaround where there is a
    conflict.

    Add support to cfg for disabling interspersed args
    
    Implements blueprint cfg-disable-interspersed-args
    
    Nova currently relies on cfg being implemented with optparse because it
    uses optparse's disable_interspersed_args()
    
    The use case for this is if you do:
    
      $> nova-manage --verbose create --project foo --user bar
    
    you want invoking ConfigOpts() to return:
    
      ['create', '--project', 'foo', '--user', 'bar']
    
    as the "extra" args rather than aborting when it doesn't recognize the
    --project arg.
    
    This is a reasonable use case for cfg to support and it should just have
    {disable,enable}_interspersed_args() methods.
    
    If we ever switch from optparse to argparse, we'll do something like this:
    
      parser.add_argument('--verbose')
      ...
      parser.add_argument(
        'extra_args',
        nargs=argparse.REMAINDER if disable_interspersed_args else '*')
      ...
      ns = parser.parse_args(...)
      extra_args = ns.extra_args
    
    i.e. we will need an 'extra_args' multi-value positional argument in any
    case and we'll just pass nargs=REMAINDER if we want trailing options to

    Add new cfg module
    
    As described here:
    
      http://wiki.openstack.org/CommonConfigModule
    
    The module implements an API for defining configuration options and
    reading values for those options that a user may have set in a config
    file or on the command line.
    
    The module is successfully in use in both Nova and Glance. Some work
    remains in Nova to switch from using it under a gflags compatible
    shim layer, but Glance is using it fully.
    
    There doesn't appear to be any blockers to other projects moving over
    to it fairly easily. Swift would perhaps be the next project to tackle.
    
    Just to go through potential future compatibility concerns:
    
      - Nova (the scroundrel) hackily uses the private ConfigOpts::_oparser
        in order to disable interspersed args. This was just for nova-manage
        and can probably be resolved some other way. In any case, Nova
        shouldn't switch to openstack-common's cfg API until it removes this
        hack.
    
      - the CommonConfigOpts subclass set of logging related options is
        perhaps assuming too much about what configuration options should
        be common across all the projects. However, it seems a fairly sane
        set and the worst that can happen is that projects avoid using it.
    
      - the parameters to the Opt constructor fairly closely mirror
        optparse, but they're fairly generic and shouldn't prevent us from
        switching to e.g. argparse
    
      - stuff like %prog expansion in the ConfigOpt's usage ctor param is a
        similar concern, but it's a very minor concern.
    
      - find_config_files() search path is perhaps too much policy for
        openstack-common; however, it is probably as generic as it could
        be and projects which need a different policy can just not use
        the function
    
    On the whole, I think we're in good shape wrt future compatibility.
