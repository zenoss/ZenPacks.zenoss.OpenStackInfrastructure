Description

This is a twisted python asynchronous library for issueing commands and
receiving or sending files over ssh.

Usage

options = {'hostname': '127.0.0.1',
           'port': 22,
           'user': 'user',
           'password': 'password',
           'identities': ['~/.ssh/id_rsa', '~/.ssh/id_dsa'],
           'buffersize': 32768}

from sshclient import SSHClient
c = SSHClient(options)

options is a dictionary containing the keys for hostname, port, user, password,
identies, and buffersize.  The password, identities, and buffersize fields are
optional.


        #options = {'hostname': '127.0.0.1',
        #           'port': 22,
        #           'user': 'user',
        #           'password': 'password',
        #           'identities': ['~/.ssh/id_rsa', '~/.ssh/id_dsa'],
        #           'buffersize': 32768}

        self.connectionTimeout = 100  # Connection timeout in seconds
        self.commandTimeout = None  # Timeout for the commands in seconds
        self.maxDelay = 200  # Maximum delay in seconds before retrying to
                            # connect.

from sshclient import SSHClient
c = SSHClient(options)

# ls a remote directory.
d=c.ls('/tmp')
display(data):
    print data
    c.disconnect()
d.addBoth(display)

# ***** WARNING ******
# This library uses the twisted reconnecting client factory.  It will not disconnect unless you tell it to.
# It is also very aggressive in reconnecting.  If you do not disconnect you will have connections increment
# and may flood your remote system.
